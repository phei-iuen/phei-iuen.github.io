I just finished my master study in **Electrical Engineering and Information Technology** at **ETH Zurich**.  I received my B.Eng. in **Automation** from **Xi'an Jiaotong University**. 

I am interested in topics including 1) optimization in machine learning and 2) dynamics of gradient algorithms. For more details, see my [CV](pdfs/CV.pdf).

### Miscellany

I love classical music, especially of Baroque era. J.S.Bach, A.Caldara and A.Hasse are among my favorate composers.

I am crazy fan of both Chinese Kunqu opera and western opera.

I know Mandarin Chinese, English, latin and some ancient Greek. If possible, I would like to learn more about other Sino-tibetan and Akkadian languages.

It was once my dream to major in paryrology, epigraphy or old Chinese phonology.

> 【折桂令】问秦淮旧日窗寮，破纸迎风，坏槛当潮，目断魂消。当年粉黛，何处笙箫？罢灯船端阳不闹，收酒旗重九无聊。白鸟飘飘，绿水滔滔，嫩黄花有些蝶飞，新红叶无个人瞧。

> 【太平令】行到那旧院门，何用轻敲，也不怕小犬哰哰。无非是枯井颓巢，不过些砖苔砌草。手种的花条柳梢，尽意儿采樵，这黑灰是谁家厨灶？
